                                The <a href = "http://faculty.washington.edu/agarcia3/Chirality-flipping/He6-CRES/">He6-CRES</a> experiment at the University of Washington is a search for physics beyond the Standard Model by studying nuclear beta decay. 
                                The data comes in the form of spectrogram 'images' where events are seen as line segments broken up into discontinuous 'tracks'. The goal of this project is to see if a computer vision model can help in the identification of events in the experiment.
                       <br><br> To accomplish this I first edited an existing CRES data simulation to include the output of ground-truth boundary boxes for events. I then wrote a PyTorch-Lightning framework for loading the data and training a
                                Faster R-CNN object detection model. I also made use of an AWS GPU instance to accelerate the work. 
                       <br><br> The model ended up working very well (a very good example spectrogram is shown above). The mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of the predicted boundary boxes to the targets achieved is over .8. This was no hyperparameter fine-tuning as the purpose of the project
                                was to establish whether the method is worth exploring for a future graduate student. The framework produced here could be used as the basis for a larger analysis of reconstructing CRES events with object
                                detection R-CNN's, or with some work could be used to begin working with an instance segmentation Mask R-CNN model.

                                In this group project we sought to describe a link between air quality at the county level and excess in the rate of low birth weight (LBW) infants in that county. 
                                Using the EPA's <a href="https://www.epa.gov/aqs">Air Quality System</a> (AQS) API we scraped 15 years of data on the levels of O<sub>3</sub>, PM2.5, PM10, CO, and NO<sub>2</sub> in the air to predict 
                                excess LBW rate with data from the CDC's <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/natality.html">WONDER</a> system. <br><br>
                                Our analysis filtered out any risk-factors in the mother in order to be able to draw a direct link between air quality and LBW. With this population
                                of mothers the mean rate of LBW births was 6.88%, and we used this to define a binary 'excess' target variable for classification models. In order to be able
                                to learn about the most relevant pollutant to the isse of high LBW we required that each pollutants data be present for an entry to be used in the analysis. This
                                ultimately led to a massive decrease in the usable data as it was rare for a county to have all pollutants measured in a given year. <br><br>
                                We paired the air quality data of the prior year to the following year in the CDC data in order to isolate the causal nature of the problem, and attempted
                                to use several different models for predictions: a neural net classifier, logistic regression, and a random forest classifier. The best performing was the neural net
                                with 75% accuracy (compare to 58% baseline). Unfortunately the other two models did not have any predictive power over baseline, and could not give information on
                                which pollutant contributed most strongly to excess LBW. The analysis could be improved on using more specific time alignment, such as using monthly 
                                data for both categories and using the prior 9 months of air quality data to predict LBW in the following month. However, it was also clear that we were dealing
                                with very much missing data, since only 7% of the data of what was originally scraped was usable.

                                Note: There's no such thing as a stupid question<br><br>
                                Using post data from r/NoStupidQuestions and r/AskReddit, and under the assumption that people posting to r/NoStupidQuestions believe the question
                                they are asking is stupid, I aimed to set out if a classification model could distinguish between posts coming from the two subreddits and tell us 
                                what makes a question 'stupid'.<br><br>
                                Using the PushShift API I scraped close to 30k total posts from the subreddits, for a baseline accuracy close to 50%. Using NLP vectorization techniques
                                I prepared the data for input into several classification models to find the best performer. I also included the post length as in EDA it was shown that
                                it was very different between the two subreddits. All models struggled with over-fitting but eventually I found a good balance with a random forest 
                                classifier that gave 77% accuracy. It turns out there is some predictive power in these subreddit posts for what makes a stupid question! 
                                I also included a streamlit app in the repo so that one can find out (with 77% accuracy) if their question is stupid or not!

                    <p>I am a sailor with over 4000 ocean miles of experience. I currently live on my boat <em>Resolution</em>, a Spencer 31, in the Seattle area. Aside from cruising I also enjoy
                    racing boats, and am currently practicing for the Van Isle 360 2023 as a member of the crew of <em>Gusto</em>, and Swan 441.<br>
                    I enjoy climbing as well, indoors and outdoors, with ropes and bouldering. When doing less active things I enjoy keeping up with whatever fantasy/sci-fi shows are currently all the rage, or reading some of the 
                        classics in these genres. Most recently I read the <em>Dune</em> series, and am now working through <em>The Dark Tower</em> series.</p>
